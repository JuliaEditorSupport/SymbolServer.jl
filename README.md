SymbolServer is a helper package for LanguageServer.jl that provides information about internal and exported variables of packages (without loading them). A `SymbolServerProcess` is intened to run either in the main or a parallel process (in which case the package must be loaded using `@everywhere using SymbolServer`).

Documentation for working with Julia environments is available [here](https://github.com/JuliaLang/Pkg.jl).
